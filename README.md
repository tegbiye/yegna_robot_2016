This is simple walking robot structure 

it has camera at the head
It is expected to move back and forth
When it moves back the head will rotate and the camera will be at the back 
and it moves to back direction

We have used the mesh files for the body part
We have added the camera_head_link, neck_link, body_link, base_link
for each we added meshes

In general the simple robot have 
  - base_link
  - Head_link
  - neck_link
  - body_link
  - body_back_right
  - body_back_left
  - right_link
  - left_link
  - foot_left_one
  - foot_left_two
  - right_link
  - foot_right_one
  - foot_right_two
